Name: Math plugin for TypeAndRun.
Version: 1.6
Author: -=GaLaN=- (Evgeniy Galantsev)

Description:
Allows to make calculations of any commplexity directly in the program's console.

Example:
(2+2)*2=<ENTER>
Text appearing in the console:
(2+2)*2=8
The answer will be selected and copied (optional) to the clipboard; you can delete/correct the expression etc.

Hints:
- plugin is not case-sensitive
- blanks in expressions allowed
- the decimal part must be separated by dot (not comma)
- expression must be written accodring to the common rules of writing math expression on a PC. For instance: x^2+sin(5*y)/exp(4*z) 
- plugin sets the following priority for math operations (in the descending order): functions, exponentiation, multiplication and division, addition and substraction;
- plugin considers parenthesis ( i.e. '(' and ')' )
- plugin knows the following operations:
	+ : addition
	- : substraction
	/ : division
	* : multiplication
	^ : exponentiation
- plugin knows the following functions:
	sin - sine
	cos - cosine
	tan - tangent
	cot - cotangent
	exp - exponent
	ln - natural logarithm
	sqr - square
	sqrt - square root
	round - rounding numbers
	trunc   - truncation
	asin    - arcsine
	acos    - arc cosine
	atan    - arc tangent
	acot    - arc cotangent
	sinh    - hyperbolic sine
	cosh    - hyperbolic cosine
	tanh    - hyperbolic tangent
	coth    - hyperbolic cotangent
- plugin knows the following numeric literals:
	pi - pi 
	e - e
- plugin understands decimals only. 

The plugin's settings are stored in tar_math.ini: 
[General]
SelectAnswer -  selection of the answer (1 is set by default)
CopyToClipboard - copying the answer to the clipboard (1 is set by default)
UseEqual - using '=' for recognition of an expression (1 is set by default)
UseOriginal - using the original expression in the answer (1 is set by default)
Round - rounding the answer (1 is set by default)
RoundLimit - от 1 до 13. The number of chars left after the dot. (13 by default)

The plugin uses the FunctionParser module. Fulfilling the wish of its author, I'm giving his licence below:
======================================================================
The given unit and classes and modules presented in it, as well as the function
recognition algorythm are the intellectual propery of Shcheglov Ilia Aleksandrovich

These class, its methods and the algorythm are freely distributed for non-commercial
use. Any other distribution of the specified information (namely --  commercial

in the commercially distrubuted programs is allowed only by the written permission

Thanks a lot to Ilia for such a great algorythm; I hope nothing in his licence has been violated. ;)

[-] removed the limit in expressions (not more than 255 symbols)

Версия 1.2 - 23.11.03
[*] fixed bug with lame output of fractional results

Версия 1.3 - 20.01.04
[*] the whole expression was put into the clipboard, not the needed answer only
[+] optional use of '=' in expressions
[+] optional display of the original expression (it still remains in the history) in the answer
