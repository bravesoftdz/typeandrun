  <li>Input file. On the right - button for choice. In a field of input files it is possible to use masks (same,
  as by regular search in an operating system. For example, *.mp3. 
  <li>Output file. If the name of an output file coincides with a name of an input file, the tag will simply be
  updated. Also it is possible to use masks: 
  <ul>
   <li><i>*</i> или <i>*.*</i> - is substituted on a real name of the processing file with the extension
   <li><i>*.ext</i> - is substituted on a filename with the extension <i>.ext</i>
   <li><i>name.*</i> - is substituted on the file <i>name</i> with the former extension
   <li><i>{filename}</i> - is substituted on a complete filename
   <li><i>{filename i1}</i> - is substituted on a piece of a filename, since i1 of a position
   <li><i>{filename i1 i2}</i> - is substituted on a piece of a filename with i1 of a position of length i2
   <li><i>{name}</i>, <i>{name i1}</i>, <i>{name i1 i2}</i> - same, but only for a filename (without the extension)
   <li><i>{ext}</i>, <i>{ext i1}</i>, <i>{ext i1 i2}</i> - same, but for the extension (with a point)
  </ul>
  <li>Depth of scanning. The most left position - without scanning subdirectories, most right - deepest scan mode.
  Select, that it is necessary. 
  <li>Whether the tag in an output file is necessary. If is removed, the tag in an output file is erased. In this
  case it would be logical to specify initial and target file identical (see item 2) 
  <li>Contents of the generalized tag. Here in the special form is written information that finally will be written
  in ID3 a tag in an output file. In fields the following constants are admitted(allowed,valid): 
  <ul>
   <li><i>{Filename}</i> - filename
   <li><i>{Name}</i> - filename (without paths and extensions)
   <li><i>{Ext}</i> - file extension (with an anticipating point)
   <li><i>{Title}</i> - header, song name, title
   <li><i>{Artist}</i> - actor
   <li><i>{Album}</i> - album
   <li><i>{Comment}</i> - Comment
   <li><i>{Year}</i> - year
   <li><i>{Genre}</i> - genre
  </ul>
  After a constant through a blank it is possible to write two integers in the decimal notation. Then the piece of
  a constant in the indicated interval (first - beginning, second - length of a piece) will be inserted.
  <br> Example: <i>{Filename 1 10}</i> - cut off from a filename the first 10 characters
  <br>Or it is possible to specify only first character - then the rest up to the end of string(line) will be copied:
  <br> <i>{FileName 5}</i> - take from the fifth character of a filename up to the end.
  <li>Presets. That is it is possible beforehand to create variants of alterations of tags, and then only to select
  necessary. By default at the configuration file is present пресет To copy - carry to an output file of a tag entry
  without changes. Buttons: 
  <ul>
   <li><i>+</i> - add preset. The program will request you his(its) name.
   <li><i>-</i> - delete selected preset.
   <li><i>*</i> - update selected preset. It is necessary to remember, that at first it is necessary to select
   necessary preset, then update tags and only then update it. The program will request preset's name (if it is
   necessary, it can be changed). 
  </ul>
  <li>Start of conversion. Current file will be displayed in status line under buttons. Also start of conversion
  can be done by pressing the Enter button in fields of editing. 
  <li>Exit with saving of parameters. Also to close program you can simply press Esc.
 </ol>
