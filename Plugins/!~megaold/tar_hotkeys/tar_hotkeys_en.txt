Name: Global hotkey management plugin for TypeAndrun.
Version: 1.0
Author: -=GaLaN=- (Evgeniy Galantsev)

Description:
Allows to create global hotkeys for running strings via TypeAndRun.

How to configure:
In the plugin's folder there's the config file "tar_hotkeys.ini". The following strings have to be added into it:
mods|key|string

WHERE:
mods - optional modifiers: A (Alt), C (Control), S (Shift) è W (Win) - in any combination, for instance:
cas
w
wca

key - the key used separately or simultaneously with modifiers. Only A...Z and 0...9 combinations are allowed, plus the keys from the list:
`
-
=
\
;
'
,
.
/
F1..F12

strings - any string. It's this string which will be sent via TypeAndRun with the help of SendMessage after pressing the hotkey.

Purpose:

There have been numerous wishes to add the hotkey program run feature to TypeAndRun. But it completely disagrees with the TypeAndRun's ideology, which is to free a user from many hotkeys. Yet, since such wishes increase constantly, I've written this plugin.
