<h1>Plugin of the extended handle of Winamp, FooBar2000, Apollo, BSPlayer</h1> 
<h2>Version: 1.15</h2> 

</center>
<h2>Author: Python &lt;smisoft@rambler.ru&gt; (c) SmiSoft (SA)</h2> 
<h3>What is this:</h3> 
<br>Intended to control popular players: Winamp, BSPlayer, FooBar2000, Apollo (the same as Winamp) through
TypeAndRun's aliases. Sertainly, before you will use aliases, the appropriate
player should be started. I recommend to use it together with plugin <em>tar_hotkey</em>
or <em>tar_hotkeys</em>
<br>The commands for Winamp are documentary only for versions above 2.6, for BSPlayer - above 0.84.
Plugin usage for players of other versions can give undesirable result.
<br>If more than one player started simultaneosely, then last player from the list
(look before) will receive appropriate command.
<h3>Aliases:</h3> 
Please, read this instruction attentively. Many aliases use similar commands,
and the detailed description with examples is given only for first aliases.

 <h3>Features:</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>When used together with tar_media, tar_amp should be placed above tar_media,
  otherwise many command will be executed incorrectly. tar_winamp is not useful
  when tar_amp installed, it is a good idea to complete delete it.
  <li>You should disable <em>Multimedia key support</em> and <em>Global hotkeys</em>
  in all players when use tar_amp together with tar_hotkey, otherwise it can result
  in double executing all operations (for example, button "previous track" will
  be clicked twice).
  <li>When plugins like GapKiller (remove silence between tracks) or Crossfader
  (smooth track switch) used, it will be some strange effects when using ~pos, ~list,
  ~prev, ~next commands. It's not a bug, but players' feature!
  <li>Tested only on <em>FooBar 0.8.3</em> and <em>Apollo 37zg</em>.
 </ul>

 <br><font color=green>[+]</font>&nbsp;tar_media plugin was modified again.
 Now, it was divided into two plugins: tar_amp (this) and tar_misc. This plugin
 intended only for players' control.
 <br><font color=blue>[*]</font>&nbsp;Error on Winamp's playlist reposition with repeat disabled

 <p><font size=+1 color=blue>Version 1.01 - 27.07.05</font>
 <br><font color=blue>[*]</font>&nbsp;FooBar control doesn't work when window was minimized

 <p><font size=+1 color=blue>Version 1.01 - 27.07.05</font>
 <br><font color=green>[+]</font>&nbsp;Absolutelly new technology of operation with the FooBar's window. Now most functions are supported for FooBar too! I thank DRON from www.delphikingdom.ru for the valuable information used when I wrote this plugin.
 <br><font color=red>[-]</font>&nbsp;Because of Apollo's API is compatible with Winamp's API, the separate support of the window Apollo has been removed. Now everything, that Winamp can, Apollo can do too.
